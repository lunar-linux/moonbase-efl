Elementary is a widget set. It is a new-style of widget set much more
canvas object based than anything else. Why not ETK? Why not EWL? Well
they both tend to veer away from the core of Evas, Ecore and Edje
a lot to build their own worlds. Also I wanted something focused on
embedded devices - specifically small touchscreens. Unlike GTK+ and
Qt, 75% of the "widget set" is already embodied in a common core -
Ecore, Edje, Evas etc. So this fine-grained library splitting means
all of this is shared, just a new widget "personality" is on top. And
that is... Elementary, my dear Watson. Elementary.
